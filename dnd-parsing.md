# D&D Parsing

Once the [markdown parser](./markdown-parsing.md) has done its job, we parse that generic object to convert it into a D&D-specific object.
These are two separate steps because we want to leave the door open to parsing data form markdown into other formsâ€”either for other TTRPG systems, or for something elseâ€”but also because the concerns of each parser are different.
The markdown parser is concerned with converting natural language into a data object.
The D&D parser is concerned with determining what in that data object has specific meaning in a D&D context and in some cases improving or detailing portions of it.

## Mapping & Normalization

Part of this process will be mapping and normalization, to allow for greater latitude when writing documents for human consumption.
Largely this will involve two types of actions:

- Enforce consistency of non-semantic elements.
  - i.e. `Longsword` => `longsword`, `some key` => `some_key`
- Mapping terms to their canonical variants.
  - i.e. `Strength` => `str`, `Challenge Rating` => `cr`
